## :wave: Hello, World! I am Raiya. 

⚙️ Computer Engineering Student @ University of Waterloo

- I'm passionate about building full-stack applications, working with embedded systems, and human-centered design.
- I enjoy programming in Python and C++, and I love picking up new corners of tech. I’m currently learning Golang, exploring ROS 2 to better understand real-world system integration and intelligent robotics, and diving into neural architecture search and other model optimization concepts :robot:
