⚙️ Computer Engineering Student @ University of Waterloo

- I'm passionate about building full-stack applications, working with embedded systems, and human-centered design.
- I enjoy programming in Python and C++, and I love picking up new corners of tech. Right now, I'm learning Go for building high-concurrency backend development, and diving into model optimization techniques to design fast, scalable real-world applications :robot:
